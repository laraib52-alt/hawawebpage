   <p>My dream is to work at Microsoft, Google, or Apple—or create my own humble AI helper that supports people with kindness and clarity.Every day, I challenge myself to grow—solving quizzes, writing code, and learning from my mistakes with courage and joy.I believe in gentle teaching, honest feedback, and building tools that make life easier for everyone.This webpage is just the beginning. Soon, I’ll add a quiz maker, a portfolio, and projects that reflect my heart and skills.</p>
